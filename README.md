These are some of the materials supporting my exploration of the cycles of gaps across stages of Eratosthenes sieve.
For the Python notebooks, see the Table of Contents file.  I uploaded the data files that I could, but a couple of 
the larger ones will have to be regenerated from the Python code, e.g. the files containing the cycles G23 and G29.

Over the years I have used R for the calculations and then Excel and Powerpoint for creating figures and tables.  
Initially I shared an Excel workbook here and was encouraged to post Python notebooks to make the work more 
accessible.  I hope these notebooks help in that regard.

NOTES on Dependencies:
03_lambda_H14929.ipynb requires the data files primes23.npy, G23uint.npy, and cG23.npy
   These were too large to upload.  They can be created with the files 01_Cycles.ipynb and 01A_closeG.ipynb

21A_p-rough_interactive.ipynb requires the data files G29uint.npy and DelPhi29.npy
   These were too large to upload.  The code to produce DelPhi29.npy is commented out in this same file.  The
   cycle G29 can be produced from code in the file 01_Cycles.ipynb
