These are some of the materials supporting my exploration of the cycles of gaps across stages of Eratosthenes sieve.
For the Python notebooks, see the Table of Contents file.  I uploaded the data files that I could, but a couple of the larger ones will have to be
regenerated from the Python code, e.g. the cycles G23 and G29.

Over the years I have used R for the calculations and then Excel and Powerpoint for creating figures and tables.  Initially I shared an Excel workbook here
and was encouraged to post Python notebooks to make the work more accessible.  I hope these notebooks help in that regard.
